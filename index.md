At the APPlied Interactive TECHnologies (AppITech) lab, we conduct applied research projects using novel interactive technologies such as **eXtended Reality (Computer Vision and Computer Graphics)** coupled to **Artificial Intelligence**. We mainly work in collaboration with companies and other research institutes (neurosciences, social work, pedagogy...).

We mainly work in the domains of health, tourism, and professional training.   

* In the health domain, we work with **companies and hospitals** to develop novel XR platforms for patients as well as for medical staff and perform **clinical studies** to test their efficacity.   
+ In the tourism domain, we have expertise to make tourist experiences more **interactive** and **contextualized**.  
- In the professional training domain, we work with partners on the field to **personalize learning experiences** using eXtended reality and artificial intelligence.
